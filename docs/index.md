Welcome to my personal knowledge base — a curated collection of notes, explanations, and resources I’ve written while learning and revising various technical topics.

This site is built with MkDocs Material and serves as both a reference and a learning log — a place where I organize thoughts, code snippets, and insights gathered over time.

To run this site locally:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```
