    participant NIC as NIC Driver / Hardware
    participant IP as IP Layer
    participant TL as Transport Layer (TCP)
    participant SockRecv as Socket Receive Buffer
    participant App as Application

    Note over NIC,App: Receive Request Flow

    NIC ->> IP: Receive packet from network
    IP ->> IP: Validate, strip IP header
    IP ->> TL: Deliver to TCP layer
    TL ->> TL: Reassemble stream, ACK handling, ordering checks
    TL ->> SockRecv: Place data into receive buffer
    SockRecv ->> App: Wake recv() → copy data to user space
