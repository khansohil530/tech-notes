    participant Process as Terminating Process
    participant Kernel as Kernel
    participant Parent as Parent Process

    Note over Process: Process finishes or is killed
    Process->>Kernel: exit(status)

    Kernel->>Kernel: Change state → TERMINATED
    Kernel->>Kernel: Release resources<br/>(files, memory, mappings)
    Kernel->>Kernel: Keep PCB + exit code<br/>Process becomes a ZOMBIE

    Kernel-->>Parent: Send SIGCHLD

    Note over Parent: Parent is notified that child has exited

    Parent->>Kernel: wait()/waitpid()
    Kernel->>Parent: Return child's exit status

    Kernel->>Kernel: Remove zombie entry<br/>Free PCB and kernel structures

    Note over Kernel: Process fully removed from system
