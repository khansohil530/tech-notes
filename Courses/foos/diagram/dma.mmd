    participant CPU
    participant DMA as DMA Controller
    participant Device as I/O Device
    participant Mem as Main Memory

    CPU->>DMA: Configure DMA (source, destination, size, direction)
    CPU->>DMA: Start DMA operation
    CPU-->>CPU: Continue other tasks

    DMA->>Device: Request data (or prepare to send)
    Device-->>DMA: Provide/receive data stream

    DMA->>Mem: Transfer data directly to/from memory
    Note over DMA,Mem: Bus arbitration, DMA controls the bus<br/>("cycle stealing" or burst mode)

    DMA->>CPU: Interrupt → DMA transfer complete
    CPU->>CPU: Handle completion and resume tasks
