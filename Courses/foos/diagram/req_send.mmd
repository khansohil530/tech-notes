sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant SockSend as Socket Send Buffer
    participant TL as Transport Layer (TCP)
    participant IP as IP Layer
    participant NIC as NIC Driver / Hardware

    Note over App,NIC: Send Request Flow

    App ->> SockSend: send()/write() → copy data to send buffer
    SockSend ->> TL: Data delivered to TCP layer
    TL ->> TL: Segment data, assign seq#, manage retransmissions
    TL ->> IP: Hand off TCP segments
    IP ->> IP: Add IP header, routing decision
    IP ->> NIC: Pass packets to NIC driver
    NIC ->> NIC: Frame packets, transmit over network
